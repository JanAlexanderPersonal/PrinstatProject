\subsection{Data cleaning and preparation\label{sec:DataCleaning}}
The provided data set contains 40 observations.
The data was prepared for analysis in the following steps:
\begin{description}
    \item[Badly encoded genders:] The gender was badly encoded for some observations due to trailing spaces, e.g. \textit{'F '} was re-encoded to \textit{'F'}.  
    \item[Missing age values: ] One observation did not include a value for age (nor gender). This observation was omitted, as was explained in \S \ref{sec:Methods}. 
    \item[Data anomalies: ] The relative quantities of both genera should end up to 100\%. It was verified that this was the case.
\end{description} 
After these operations, the final data-set used for the analysis in this document was obtained. The distribution of the observations over the categories BMI and Gender is shown in table \ref{tab:DistObsBMIGender}.
\input{tables/table_Observations_BMI_Gender.tex}

Figure \ref{fig:agedist}, shows the heavy skewness of the patient's age distribution. 
There are few older patients in the data set.
