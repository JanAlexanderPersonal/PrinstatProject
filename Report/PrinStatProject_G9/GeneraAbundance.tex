Since the armpit microbiome only contains two genera of bacteria, the relative abundance of one defines the other.
Malodor is caused mainly by Corynebacteria. 
The analysis focuses on the relative abundance of this genus.
The abundance of the Staphylococcus genus is simply $100\% - RGA$ of Corynebacteria.

\subsubsection{Basic statistics}
Table \ref{tab:BacteriaStatistics} contains the basic statistics of the relative distributions of the different bacteria species.
The RGA shows a strongly skewed distribution. 
The relative Corynebacteria abundance is very low (only 3.2\%) for at least half of the patients.
Nevertheless, the armpit microbiome relative concentration of Corynebacteria can be as high as 97\%. This is visualized in figure \ref{fig:boxplot_cory}.

    \label{fig:boxplot_cory}
\end{figure}

Within the same genus, the skewness of the data is clear from the second part of the table.
The \textit{Staphylococcus} species 2, 3 and 4 are completely absent in at least half the samples. Nevertheless, the RSA of \textit{Staphylococcus.2} can reach up to 89.7\%.

\subsubsection{Age as a categorical variable \label{sec:AgeCategorical}}
Due to the relatively low number of observations, it was chosen to deviate from the original plan to divide the patients in 4 categories divided at 30, 40 en 50 years old.
This resulted in categories containing a very low number of observations. 
This would have yielded the power of the statistical tests undesirably low. \todo{All}{Is this correct? Is this the best way to put it? }
Instead, the patients were split in 2 age categories: \textit{40 and younger} and \textit{over 40}.
The age of 40 years is chosen because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The mean age of a Belgian is 40.8 years \footnote{Census Belgi\"e, 2011 -  \texttt{https://www.census2011.be/
    data/fresult/age-avg\_nl.html}}.
    \item 40 is close to half of the oldest patient age and the mean participant age.
\end{itemize}

The difference in RGA of Corynebacteria can be observed in figure \ref{fig:BoxplotAge} and from table \ref{tab:CoryStats_AgeCat}.
For most people of maximum 40 years old in this data set, a lower RGA (<10\%) of Corynebacteria is observed (with 4 exceptions). 
The distribution of RGA of Corynebacteria for people over 40 years old shows more variability, the IQR is higher.
The center of this distribution (both the median and the mean) is higher.
The (two-sided) WMW-test indicates a p-value < 0.01, indicating that $H_0$ (no location shift between category \textit{'40 or younger'} and category \textit{'over 40'}) should be rejected.

    \label{fig:BoxplotAge}
\end{figure}


Apart from the patient's age, two other patient characteristics are known:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Whether the patient's BMI is over 25.
    \item The patient's gender.
\end{enumerate}

\input{tables/table_AgeCat_Cory.tex}

Before concluding we observed a location shift between the relative bacteria genus abundances in the armpit microbiome in different age categories, 
we wish to investigate the possible influence the two other mentioned parameters may have.
Secondly, we want to investigate if there is a significant difference between both age categories in BMI or gender composition.

In table \ref{tab:ageDistrAfterDiscr}, the distribution of the patients in the categories is shown.
